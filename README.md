# YAFF
"Yet Another FFmpeg Frontend" is an ASP.NET Core MVC frontend for FFmpeg, specifically for audio conversion.

At the moment, this works only for audio files.

For legal reasons, you should provide your own compiled version of FFmpeg (available freely at https://ffmpeg.org/). Place it in the /YAFF/ directory, and name it `ffmpeg.exe`.
